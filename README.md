# FifaTeamAlgoritm
In this engaging  project, I developed a simulation to optimize the process of selecting a professional team for a small contest - the University World Cup. The primary objective is to gain insights into the key factors, such as potential, overall performance, team chemistry, computational burden, and time constraints, involved in assembling a team of highly skilled individuals to compete effectively in this prestigious event.

Using the powerful combination of Jupyter Notebook, Python, and a recursive genetic algorithm, this project aims to revolutionize the team selection process by considering a holistic approach that goes beyond individual skill evaluation. By incorporating various factors, we aim to create teams that not only possess exceptional skills but also exhibit excellent chemistry and synergy, ensuring optimal performance on the global stage.
