# FifaTeamAlgoritm
In this project, I aim to simulate the process of choosing a professional team for a small contest in the university. The objective is to understand the key factors such as potential and overall and considerations involved in assembling a team of highly skilled individuals to compete effectively in the world cup.
This project considers not only team skill and chemistry but also takes into account the computational bourden and time spend with the algoritm.
This code was developed in jupyter notebook using python and employes a recursive genetic algoritm.
